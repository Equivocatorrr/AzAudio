                <h3>About The Guide</h3>
                <p>This guide is meant to be a simple and informative guide to using the latest version of the library. As of this writing, the library is in an early stage of development and many things are subject to change. I will do my best to keep this guide up-to-date and accurate but I cannot guarantee at this time that it will always be representative of the latest version. In the future, this will not be an issue, since most things will not change that much, if at all.</p>
                <p>If you notice anything out-of-date feel free to send me an email detailing which part needs updating, and I'll get to it as soon as I can.</p>

                <p>Azure Audio is a cross-platform audio library for games being written in C with the mission to bring powerful, feature-full 3D audio to developers of various backgrounds in audio. It is meant to be a simple, extensible, easy-to-use API that you can include in your projects for commercial or non-commercial use. You are encouraged to write your own modifications for any new features you may desire, or you may request a feature by contacting me. I do ask that, should you make any modifications (improvements, additions, etc.), that you consider sending them to me so I can add them to the core library, but you are in no way required to do so. The only condition to using this library is attribution to the original author, as detailed in the <a href=#license>license</a>.</p>
                <p>On top of this will be a C++ wrapper library that will act as a high-level abstraction library designed to make use of the library as clean and easy as possible while maintaining control over how it works. With this, many default settings will be provided to make practical use very simple, while still allowing lower-level access whenever necessary or desired.</p>

                <p>I'm Philip, an enthusiast programmer with experience in a number of technical fields, including sound engineering - Particularly music production from start to finish. Coupled with this experience is my insatiable appetite for learning new things, which is part of why I started this project in the first place.</p>
                <p>I used to go by a large number of names online (still do to a degree), but more recently I've been settling in to using the pseudonym <i>Azure</i> for all my profiles. Alternatively, for most programming projects I've been using <i>Singularity</i>, hence <i>SingularityAzure</i>. Though solely for the sake of alliteration, I had to go with <i>Azure Audio</i> for this project's name.</p>
                <p>I'm always open to feedback and am more than happy to answer any questions you may have. Should you have an inquiry, you can contact me via email at<br/></p>
